### Photostream Photo Grid

A simple, minimalist site for a photo grid, built in react.

Undergoing a front-end overhaul.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### Adding Images

In the meantime, images should be added to public/img.

The photos on the photostream will pick up all images from that directory automatically, and make a fully fledged image stream on your main page. Further changes on the way.
